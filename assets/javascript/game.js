/*

- * graphic makes it to moon on win and then displays something clever, maybe change out planets so go from earth to moon, mars, jupiter, uranus, 
    - loss sends them back to earth prematurely because of various excuses
- * onload, generate 1 random number between 19-120 & display on page, make the distance between ship and moon that many spaces
- * generate 4 more random numbers between 1-12 and assign to icons1-4
- * when player clicks an icon, that number is added to their score
- * if the number they click is <= the targetNumber, keep guessing and adding that number to their score
    - move space ship towards moon same number of space they guessed
- * if their score exceeds the targetNumber they lose
    - add to loss count, reset the numbers, a meteor shower made them start mission over
- * if their score == target number, they win, add to win count, reset game
